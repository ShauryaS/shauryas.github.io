			<h2>Programming Skills</h2>
			<div id="LanguagesList">
				<h3>Languages</h3>
				<div id="Java">
					<h4>Java</h4>
					<p>I have been coding in Java for four years. I started learning through codecademy on my own. After completing the Codecademy Java course, I took more Java lessons to enhance my skills. Once entering high school, I took the Java course as one of my electives as a Freshman. During my Sophomore year of high school, I completed the AP Computer Science. Taking my java knowledge to the next level, I make apps for android. I use Java to code various algorithms and solve challenges that come up in life.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="Swift">
					<h4>Swift</h4>
					<p>I have been coding in Swift for one year. I learned swift on my own and began implementing what I learned into making basic applications. I use swift to code applications for devices that run ios. I have converted some of my android applications into an ios application.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="HTMLCSS">
					<h4>HTML+CSS</h4>
					<p>I have been coding in HTML and CSS for about a two years. I began learning through Codecademy and using the basic knowledge that I gained, I made my own website. I have learned to use various frameworks for building websites and I use them to simplify the process of developing websites and to make websited interactive.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="JavaScript">
					<h4>JavaScript</h4>
					<p>I have been coding in JavaScript for about a year. I have learned how to use it to make websites more interactive. I also know how to use JavaScript to code applications for the Pebble. I use JavaScript to make my websites more interactive for the user.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="OtherLangs">
					<h4>Other Programming Languages</h4>
					<p>Once learning how to program in Java and excelling in it, I seeked to expand my programming knowledge. I can code fluently in Python, C++, c#, and Objective C.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="PlatformsList">
				<h3>Platforms</h3>
				<div id="Mobile">
					<h4>Mobile</h4>
					<div id="Android">
						<h4>android</h4>
						<p>I use Android Studio to develop applications on the Android Platform. The majority of the code can be done in Java with slight modifications to the syntax. I have coded various applications on the Android Platform, but my major applications for Android are a Hotspot Chat Communication application, a Test Study Planner application, and a Tic Tac Toe, both single and multiplayer, application.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="ios">
						<h4>ios</h4>
						<p>I use XCode to develop applications on the ios platform. The entire code is done in the programming language that Apple created, called Swift. A project that I made for this platform was the Test Study Planner application that functions on ios.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="Desktop">
					<h4>Desktop</h4>
					<p>Most of my applications for the desktop are coded in Java. Java is my main language used when coding. When necessary to code a project in a different language, I can use C++, Python, Objective C, and C# since I am just as familiar in these coding languages as in Java. I have developed multiple projects for the Desktop platform, but some of my main projects that I have developed are Network Battlefield, Tetris, Alien Invader, Predation Simulator, and a never ending maze game. I have also developed an application that can solve various different math problems.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="Web">
					<h4>Web</h4>
					<p>When developing web applications, I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks. I have developed my own personal website so that people can view who I am and what I do. I have developed a couple other websites, but my main focus on developing is for mobile platforms.</p>

				<h4>Martial Arts</h3>
				<img src="http://bibbinstkd.yolasite.com/resources/img_pd_180309_yimd6h.jpg" width="95%" height="95%"/>
				<p>I am a second degree blackbelt holder in Taekwondo. I started doing Taekwondo in 2008. My Taekwondo journey took five years and I finally got my first degree black belt in 2013. Instead of ending my Taekwondo Journey there, I decided to continue my journey to get my second degree blackbelt, which I got in 2014. And I didn't stop my journey there. I am currently training hard and working towards getting my third degree black belt.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="BoysScouts">
				<h4>Boys Scouts</h3>
				<p>I am a Boys Scout. Currently, I am the rank of Life. When I started Boys Scouts, I wasn't thinking of going up the ranks. In fact, I was never planning to get Eagle Scout. My parents put me in scouting in hoped that I would gain back my self confidence. I joined because I wanted to experience camping and the adventure at the same time as learning new skills. The way scouting was structured to provide boys with fun and new skills to learn put me on a path to gain ranks and aim for becoming an Eagle Scout. And now, with many skills and lots of adventures, I am one step away from becoming an Eagle Scout.</p>
